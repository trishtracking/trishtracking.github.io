        <p> Create a personal website
            Create a one-page website in HTML and CSS (using some vanilla JavaScript if you’d like) and host it on GitHub Pages. Your commit history should tell a story, and your website must be written by you, and:
            
            - Show us with your code who you are
            - Demonstrate your learning from the prerequisites
            - Tell us about why you are applying for the programme
            - Contain a link back to the GitHub repo that contains the code for your site
            - Contain links to your freeCodeCamp (please make sure that your profile is public) and Codewars pages
            - Include an image carousel (the image carousel must be built into your website, a link to a separate page or CodePen will not be accepted)
            - Be hosted on GitHub
            - Not use a GitHub theme
            - Not use any JavaScript or CSS libraries like Bootstrap or jQuery or use an image carousel package like Flickity ⁠— we want to see your own code.</p>
